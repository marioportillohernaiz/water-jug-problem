# water-jug-problem

Consider the following water-jug problem. There are 3 jugs that have capacities of A gallons, B gallons, and C gallons. A pump with an unlimited supply of water is available which can be used to fill the jugs. Water may be poured from one jug to another or to the ground. None of the jugs has any measuring marks on it. In the start state, all the three jugs are empty. This is denoted (0, 0, 0); the first number is the amount of water in the A-gallon jug, the middle number is the amount of water in the B-gallon jug, and the last number is the amount of water in the C-gallon jug. 
For example, if A=8, B=5, and C=3, a possible next state is (8, 0, 0) which is reached by pouring water into the 8-gallon jug. From the state (8, 0, 0) a possible next state is (5, 0, 3) which is reached by pouring water from the 8-gallon jug to the 3-gallon jug. From the state (5, 0, 3) a possible next state is (0, 0, 3) which is reached by pouring water from the 8-gallon jug to the ground. 

The question is: Implement the above high-level depth-first search algorithm in Java. Your program must be well commented and all data structures you use must be clearly described at the beginning of the program. In another section, state how much time it takes for your program to generate the complete output once the execution starts
